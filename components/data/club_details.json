We aspire to leave a mark that the future leaders can follow and provide a change for the betterment of their own self as well as the society.\nThe most important asset of our club are the members, who provide their valuable ideas to bring a change in the society. For all of us here Rotaract is an extended family. We rise together, we face hardships together!\nWe have planned to bring change in the society by focusing on prime issues regarding women empowerment, children's education, proper sanitation, food, and clothing. As the world is going through a tough pandemic situation, being out in the open and helping the needy is quite a challenge now. Our present leader believes in facing all the hardships and providing maximum help to as many individuals as possible. As we believe no matter the problem we must come up with a solution.\nOur club has also been known for organizing unique and versatile flagship events with each having a different moto.We have Rakhi with Men in Khaki as a gesture of respect towards the protectors of the society.Then we have Shyama Arghya where we celebrate the auspicious festival of Diwali and expand our friendship and bond. Then we have Pro Soccer where we provide a platform for the footballers to showcase their talent. Then we have Lunch Box where we spread love by feeding the needy on Valentine's day and lastly we have Ek-sathe Baishakh where we celebrate Bengali New Year with all our fellow Rotaractors. \n\nAll these special events show our versatility and uniqueness for making our society a better and uplifted place to live in. This makes us different from the rest.",

We consider the ideas and opinions and respect the suggestions put in by every single individual in the club. We are going through a global pandemic that has made it difficult for everyone to step out and work for our community. But the club has made great efforts to contribute to the welfare of society and made every possible event successful through the digital medium. When the world had stopped working during this pandemic, we ROTARACTORS were working day and night to contribute to our community by all means possible. \n\nNone of these would have been possible without our hard-working and inspiring President and our enthusiastic team who are the backbone of our club. Here, we are a family. We appreciate each other in the works they do and being young enthusiasts, we try to grow together with our hard work and efforts. Every single member is given some responsibilities and has an integral role to play so that one has an idea of how the team-building and leadership skills work and can be enhanced which they can later put forward in their professional lives. Everyone is given opportunities to explore the Rotaract journey in their own way so that they can understand the perspective of the global organization at large. Our club has tried to improve every corner of the community. We build trust, commitment, honesty, and understanding in ourselves since these are the key features that make a team “A TEAM”. \n\nWe are trying to turn dreams into reality by working for the betterment of society by putting our small efforts and changes. Our aim is to rejoice in our fellowship in the true spirit and bring great success to our club and make this world a better place to live in.\nLastly, once Henry Ford said, \"Coming together is a beginning, staying together is progress, and working together is success\".",

With the 12th year of the club rising beyond all barriers amidst the pandemic, the 13th year will look forward to adapt in these new normal ways and improve our service towards the community . We dreamt, trusted and achieved success in giving wings to our dreams, believing in a better tomorrow. And that belief will guide us in transcending our wings beyond horizon .\n\nPegasus is a mythical winged divine horse in Greek mythology that symbolises strength and healing . As we step into the post pandemic lifestyle, we aim at healing people's minds and empower them with new hope and strength. Our logo symbolises courage for better days and a spirit of bravery and energy to take in all new challenges that will come on our way . Our motto for the term is to improve the previous ways along with adapting new ones to excel in our service towards the community and giving wings to our dreams.",

It also helps the members to create bonds among themselves and as a result help them to socialise. Till date we've organised a few events, namely, sapling plantation, COVID vaccination campaign for teachers, staffs, and the students. The University Club also provided ration to the needy during the pandemic. There was also an orphanage visit during the pre-COVID scenario. It brings an opportunity for the college students to exchange ideas  in the community, develop leadership and professional skills, and gain confidence through their work.

We also go for sponsorships. Our club holds conferences and assemblies that provides us with entertainment along with education and service. We organize various events and functions twice or thrice a month through which we help the orphanages, old age homes, children of slums and others. Plantation Drives were also held. We work for \"Women Empowerment\" too by promoting sense of self-worth and their ability to determine their own choices. Here we say: \"Giving and helping others without a single expectation of getting back anything in return is our biggest satisfaction.\" ❤️🤝🏻",
